What does this do?

1. this pulls data from lightspeed and slingshot.com to compare prices 
2 the result is a csv file that indicates all products where SLingshot is selling it for LESS than Windance. these priducts should be updated. 

to do: 
1. create a workflow to run this each week? (daily seems uneccesary) 
2. write blsatula file email csv. to windance@windance.com each monday. 


the Future: 
this script can code flow can easily be updated to include 3 other brands.

North
Mystic. 

Goal: 
More easily keep our pricing inline with our brands that are on shopify.
